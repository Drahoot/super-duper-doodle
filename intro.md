# Greetings!

My name is Ryan McMillan and im very bad at creating labs!
now you might thinking otherwise but boy oh boy am I about to prove you wrong.
I think now is a perfect time to seque into a better topic... 

***ME!!!***

Im a young and inspired developer in the making and am glad to join the code fellows crew with everything it has to offer and more. 
Some day I hope that I can start to create my own projects that leave an impact on people.
